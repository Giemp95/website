# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I’ve been a PhD student in Smart Computing at the University of Florence since November 2019. I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer and Information Engineering at the University of Siena, where a few years later, I got also my Master's Degree Cum Laude in Computer and Automation Engineering, defending a thesis called “Graph Neural Network for the prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions”. During my work for the Master’s Thesis I’ve been so interested Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that I decided to continue my studies in these topics by applying for the PhD. I want to make use of the knowledge acquired during my education in order to improve people’s quality of life. Indeed, my dream is to succeed with my work in helping others, by developing new models and supporting them by some theoretical insight and by a wide experimentation, particularly devoted to biomedical applications. I would like to grow both as a single person and as a member of a team, positively influencing the achievement of common goals.
