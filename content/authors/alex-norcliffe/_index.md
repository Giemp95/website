I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, co-supervised by Mihaela van der Schaar and Pietro Liò. I am funded by a CCAIM studentship, generously provided by AstraZeneca and GSK.
 
I am interested in modelling dynamical systems with Neural Differential Equations, especially in the context of disease progression. I'm also interested in Generative Modelling to create synthetic data for training supervised models.
